# XLMerge
A program to merge multiple Excel files into one.
This is a work in progress still. 
This program will ask for a directory folder where your excel files are stored. 
You can enter the directory manually or use the built in directory navigator.
Once the directory is selected then list all the files in the directory to list the files that will be merged.
Once listed click "Merge" and you will be prompted to confirm the files that will be merged as well as being asked for a file name for the master file. 
Ensure that with the desired master file name you add the ".xlsx" extension.
Then confirm the merge and click "Exit and Create Files" in order to close the application and finish merging the excel files.
This program will take into account your headers and they will NOT be transfered to the main file. (Possible feature in future to add headers from the first file that is read into the master)
